## Basic Overview
Welcome to the Seconds Timer console application! This small project of uselessness showcases how to work with TimeSpan, DateTime, Beep, and Sleep inside a .NET (C#) Console Application.

## How To Run
Download the Program.exe file and double-click to run the application. 

If it works properly, the timer will count up to how many seconds that you provide the application when prompted while simultaneously beeping. (It sounding like a bomb about to go off was unintentional.)

If you want to compile it yourself, I have provided all of the necessary CS files.
