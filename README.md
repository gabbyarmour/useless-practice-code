# Welcome!
## Introduction
This repository is where I will be keeping my endless stream of useless code. When I need to practice programming, I make silly apps to help me remember programming concepts. Some of this code is inspired by the coding/programming tutorials that I watch. I don't directly replicate anyone else's code here.

## Basic Instructions
I have provided any code that I have used within the folder that a particular project is stored within this repository. Usually, these projects will be written using some version of Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code. Right now, I mostly program using C# and script using Python/JavaScript.
